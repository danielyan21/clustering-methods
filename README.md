### Vignette Abstract

For this project, we are showcasing how clustering methods can be applied to various datasets. For our specific vignette, we chose the user behavior dataset that lists a person's phone model, operating system, app usage, battery life, etc. 
Our objective for this vignette is compare three different clustering methods -- k means, spectral, and agglomerative -- to group users based on similarities on their usage patterns. We will go through how to implement each of three methods by using this data set. 

### Repository Contents 
-   `data` contains

    -   `user_behavior_dataset.csv` raw data

    -   `knn_script.py` script used to generate the processed data

    -   `spectral_script.py` concise version of in-class codes used to replicate published analysis

    -   `agglomerative_script.py` concise version of in-class codes used to replicate published analysis


-   `results` contains a report template `primary-vignette.ipynb` and `primary-vignette.html`

-   `img` contains graphs from the various scripts
